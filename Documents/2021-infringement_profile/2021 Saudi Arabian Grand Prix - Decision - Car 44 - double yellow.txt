From The Stewards To The Team Manager, Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 TeamDocument 20 Date 04 December 2021 Time 19:42 2021 SAUDI ARABIAN GRAND PRIX 2 - 5 December 2021 The StewardsThe Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (document 17) and heard from the driver and team representative, have considered the following matter and determine the following: No / Driver 44 - Lewis Hamilton Competitor Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team Time 17:22 Session Practice 3 Fact Alleged failure to respect double yellow flags/lights. Offence Alleged breach of Appendix H, Art. 2.5.5.b) of the FIA International Sporting Code. Decision No further action. Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 44 (Lewis Hamilton), the team representative and have reviewed video and the marshalling system. The Race Director reported to the Stewards that the double yellow flag warning on the FIA Marshalling System was activated at Light Panel Number 6 accidentally, for less than 1 second. As the on-board video of Car 44 (to be released by the Commercial Rights Holder following this Decision) clearly shows, there was no yellow flag displayed, no yellow lights were displayed to that driver and the yellow warning light was not visible on the driverâ€™s steering wheel. Unlike other incidents this year, there was no yellow flag or yellow light displayed to the driver (the driver already being well into the marshalling sector when the system was briefly activated) hence no breach of the regulations has occurred. Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
