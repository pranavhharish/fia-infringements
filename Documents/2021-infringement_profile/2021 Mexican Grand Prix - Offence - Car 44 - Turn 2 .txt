Offence Breach of Article 12.2.2.1.i) of the FIA International Sporting Code. Decision Reprimand (Driving) (This is the driver’s 1st reprimand of the season) Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 44 (Lewis Hamilton) and team representative. Car 44 left the track on the left hand-side between turns 1 and 2 and re-joined the track between turns 2 and 3, rather than re-joining by driving to the left-hand side of the bollard at turn 3. Whilst noting the driver’s comments in relation to track conditions and his attempt to steer to the left after leaving the track, the Stewards consider this to be a failure to follow the Race Director’s instruction given in article 21.1a) of the Race Director’s Event Notes. Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
