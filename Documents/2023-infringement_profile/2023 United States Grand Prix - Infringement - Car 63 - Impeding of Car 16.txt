2023 UNITED STATES GRAND PRIX 20 - 22 October 2023 From The Stewards To The Team Manager, Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 TeamDocument 30 Date 21 October 2023 Time 14:35 The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following matter and determine the following: No / Driver 63 - George Russell Competitor Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 Team Time 12:41 Session Sprint Shootout Fact Car 63 unnecessarily impeding Car 16 in turn 19 at 12:41. Infringement Breach of Article 37.5 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations. Decision Drop of 3 grid positions for the next Sprint/Race in which the driver participates. Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 63 (George Russell), the driver of Car 16 (Charles Leclerc), team representatives and reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, timing team radio and in-car video evidence. Car 63 entered the last two corners preparing for his flying lap at the end of SQ1 with Car 16 closing in quickly. Whilst the team did inform the driver about the closing car a few seconds in advance, there was no further information directly before Car 63 entered Turn 19 with Car 16 right behind. Car 63 did not move from the racing line in or after Turn 19 and therefore unnecessarily impeded Car 16. The Stewards note that irrespective of any information coming from the team, it is the driverâ€™s responsibility to ensure that no other cars are unnecessarily impeded. Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits. Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
