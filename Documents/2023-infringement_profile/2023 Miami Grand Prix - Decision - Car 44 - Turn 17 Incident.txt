2023 M IAMI GRAND PRIX 05 - 07 May 2023 The StewardsFrom The Stewards To The Team Manager, Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 TeamDocument 31 Date 06 May 2023 Time 18:15 The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 27 & 28) and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and determine the following: No / Driver 44 - Lewis Hamilton Competitor Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 Team Time 16:06 Session Qualifying Fact Incident in turn 17. Infringment Alleged breach of Article 33.4 and 37.5 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations. Decision No further action. Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 20 (Kevin Magnussen), the driver of Car 44 (Lewis Hamilton), team representatives and reviewed video, team radio and in-car video evidence and determined that Car 20 was on a slow lap, with another slow car in front of it. Car 44 was on an in-lap and could see Car 20 at the end of the straight. The unexpectedly high speed differential between the two cars resulted in Car 44 having to take evasive action to avoid a collision. Given that neither car was on a fast lap and the fact that Car 20 had another slow car ahead of it, we did not consider either driver to be driving dangerously. Given that they were not on fast laps, there was no question of impeding either. So in the circumstances, we decided to take no further action. Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
