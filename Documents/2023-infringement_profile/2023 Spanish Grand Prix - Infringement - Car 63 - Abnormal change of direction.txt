Infringment Breach of Article 2b Chapter IV, Appendix L of the FIA International Sporting Code. Decision Formal warning to the driver and the team. Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 63 (George Russell), the driver of Car 44 (Lewis Hamilton), team representatives and reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, team radio and in-car video evidence. The driver of Car 63 stated that as he was just starting his fast lap he was looking forward and had not checked his mirrors. His team did not inform him of the approach of Car 44. However in mitigation, he was reacting to the car in front of him (Car 55) which had just finished its fast lap. In addition at the end of his out lap the driver of Car 63 had to slow significantly to avoid impeding Cars 1 and 55. Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits. Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
