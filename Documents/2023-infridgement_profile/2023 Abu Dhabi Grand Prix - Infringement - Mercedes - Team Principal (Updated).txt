2023 ABU DHABI GRAND PRIX 24 - 26 November 2023 Having been delegated, by the Stewards of the 2023 Las Vegas Grand Prix, the authority in accordance with Article 11.9.3.w of the FIA International Sporting Code, and having received the delegated authority from the USA ASN (ACCUS) to the UAE ASN steward, to investigate a report from the FIA Media Delegate in relation to the language used by the Team Principal of Mercedes- AMG Petronas F1 Team during the FIA Press Conference on Thursday 16 November 2023, and having summonsed the Team Principal (document 6) and having received a submission from the FIA and examined a transcript of the relevant part of the Press Conference, the Stewards determine that余 1. A breach of Article 12.2.1.f of the FIA International Sporting Code has been committed by the Team Principal in that the language used is not consistent with the values defended by the FIA余 2. Based on the submission from the FIA, the FIA regards language of this type to be unacceptable moving forward, particularly when used by participants in the sport who have a high public profile and who are seen by many, especially younger, followers of the sport, as role models, and that in future the FIA will not tolerate the use of such language in FIA forums by any stakeholder余 3. Based on the submission from the Team Principal, the use of the language concerned was in this case unusual and was provoked by an abrupt interjection during the Press Conference and therefore cannot be regarded as typical from this Team Principal余 4. Considering the mitigating circumstances in point 3 above, the Stewards in this case issue a formal Warning. Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits. Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
