2024 SAUDI ARABIAN GRAND PRIX 07 - 09 March 2024 From The Stewards To The Team Manager, Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 TeamDocument 16 Date 07 March 2024 Time 21:54 The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 13 & 14) and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and determine the following: No / Driver 44 - Lewis Hamilton Competitor Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 Team Time 20:16 Session Practice 2 Fact Car 44 unnecessarily impeding Car 2 in Turn 11 at 20:16. Infringement Breach of Article 37.5 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations. Decision Warning. The competitor (Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 Team) is fined €15,000. Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 44 (Lewis Hamilton), the driver of Car 2 (Logan Sargeant), team representatives and reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, team radio and in-car video evidence and determine that Car 44 impeded Car 2 at Turn 11. As a result, Car 2 had to take evasive action by going off the track to avoid a collision. Had that not been done, there would have been a serious, high speed crash. Having listened to the team radio, it was clear to us that the team of Car 44 failed to warn their driver of the fact that Car 2 was arriving on a fast lap. That was a serious failure on the part of the team, particularly given the speeds on this circuit and the nature of turn 11, which is at the end of a series of high speed corners where driver visibility is impaired. We therefore issue a warning to the driver and impose a fine of €15,000 to the team. Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits. Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
