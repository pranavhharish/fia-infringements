2024 UNITED STATES GRAND PRIX 18 - 20 October 2024 The StewardsFrom The Stewards To The Team Manager, Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 TeamDocument 65 Date 20 October 2024 Time 14:47 The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following matter and determine the following: No / Driver 63 - George Russell Competitor Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 Team Time 14:27 Session Race Fact Forcing car 77 off the track at turn 12. Infringement Breach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 b) of the International Sporting Code. Decision 5 second time penalty. Reason The Stewards reviewed positioning/marshalling system data and in-car video evidence. The Driving Standard Guidelines provide that when overtaking on the inside the driver must not force the other car off the track and must leave a fair and acceptable width for the car being overtaken. This did not occur on this occasion. However in mitigation, a 5 second penalty is imposed instead of the standard 10 second penalty because the Stewards determine that the forcing off track was not deliberate, and the driver of Car 63 was in control of the car at all times. Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits. Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
