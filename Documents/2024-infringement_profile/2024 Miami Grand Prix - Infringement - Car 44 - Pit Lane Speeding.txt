2024 M IAMI GRAND PRIX 03 - 05 May 2024 From The Stewards To The Team Manager, Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 TeamDocument 41 Date 04 May 2024 Time 13:24 The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following matter and determine the following: No / Driver 44 - Lewis Hamilton Competitor Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 Team Time 13:12 Session Sprint Fact Pit lane speeding â€“ 90.7 km/h Infringement Breach of Article 34.7 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations. Decision Drive through penalty. (20 seconds added to elapsed Sprint time). Reason Car 44 exceeded the pit lane speed limit which is set at 80 km/h for this event by 10.7 km/h. Per the Penalty Guidelines, the penalty for speeding in the pit lane during a sprint session race by between 6-15km/h is a drive through. This is what we impose. As the drive through penalty was imposed during the last three laps, it will be converted to a 20 second time penalty per Article 54.3 (d) of the Formula One Sporting Regulations. Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits. Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
