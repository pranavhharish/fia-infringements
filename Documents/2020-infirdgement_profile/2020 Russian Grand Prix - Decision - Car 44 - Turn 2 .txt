Offence Alleged breach of Article 12.1.1.(i) of the FIA International Sporting Code. Decision No further action. Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 44 (Lewis Hamilton) and team representative and have reviewed video evidence. The driver left the track at turn 2 and did not manage to re-join the track as defined in the Event Notes (v3) 22.1. The driver accepted that he had not followed the instructions and further he accepted that in a race there would be a penalty. The Stewards determined that there was no advantage, as the relevant lap time was deleted according to Doc 27. Furthermore, to be consistent with previous decisions, the Stewards considered the precedents set out in Doc. 25 of the 2018 Spanish Gran Prix and Doc. 31 of the 2019 Canadian Grand Prix. The Stewards remind all teams and drivers, that a failure to negotiate turn 2 as defined in the Event Notes during the race will likely lead to a 5 sec time penalty. Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and Article 10.1.1 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
