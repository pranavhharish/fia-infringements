Offence Alleged breach of Article 37.5 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations. Decision No further action. Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 44 (Lewis Hamilton), the driver of Car 55 (Carlos Sainz) and team representatives and examined video and radio evidence. The Stewards determined that Car 55 was approaching turn 13 at higher speed than Car 44. Car 55 was finishing a fast lap while Car 44 was preparing for the next lap. During the hearing, both drivers and team representatives recognised that it is well understood that impeding during free practice should be looked at in a more lenient way by the Stewards unless it is a dangerous manoeuvre. Both drivers also highlighted that the configuration of the track is propitious for impeding and that Car 55 was not significantly impacted by the action. Therefore, the Stewards decided to take no further action. Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
