From The Stewards To The Team Manager, Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 TeamDocument 65 Date 28 August 2022 Time 15:53 2022 BELGIAN GRAND PRIX 25 - 28 August 2022 The StewardsThe Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following matter and determine the following: No / Driver 44 - Lewis Hamilton Competitor Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team Time 15:04 Session Race Fact Collision with car 14 at turn 5. Offence Breach of Article 2 d) Chapter IV Appendix L of the FIA International Sporting Code. Decision No further action. Reason The Stewards reviewed the video evidence and determined that Alonso was on the inside at turn 5. Hamilton’s front wheels were ahead of Alonso’s at the entry to the corner. Alonso moved his car off line to the inside with both right side tyres fully on the kerb and even somewhat inside the kerb. At no point did Alonso appear to lose control or understeer. Hamilton turned into towards the apex of the corner with Alonso still along side and the collision occurred. The Stewards considered that this was a first lap incident with a lot of movement relative to other cars in the first few corners, and thus take no further action. Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
