From The Stewards To The Team Manager, Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 TeamDocument 32 Date 11 June 2022 Time 21:21 2022 AZERBAIJAN GRAND PRIX 9 - 12 June 2022 The StewardsThe Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 26 & 27) and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and determine the following: No / Driver 44 - Lewis Hamilton Competitor Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team Time 18:59 Session Qualifying Fact Allegedly driving unnecessarily slowly during Qualifying. Offence Alleged breach of Article 33.4 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations. Decision No further action. Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 44 (Lewis Hamilton), the driver of Car 4 (Lando Norris) and the team representatives, and examined video, radio communication and GPS evidence. The driver, in evidence, stated that he did slow down in order to endeavour to be passed by car 4, to achieve a “tow” on his fast lap, however car 4 obviously had the same intent and decided not to pass him. Although car 44 was slow, the Stewards note that for the lap the delta time was respected, the driver pulled over to the left and off the racing line, this occurred on a straight where visibility was not an issue and there was no potential danger at any point, to any other driver. The three cars on this portion of track at the time (cars 44, 4 and 3) were all on “out” laps. Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
