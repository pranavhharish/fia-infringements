Offence Breach of Appendix L, Chapter III of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations. Decision No further action. Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 44 (Lewis Hamilton), the team representative and have reviewed video and audio evidence. Broadcast footage showed HAM wearing an item of jewellery in the form of a body piercing (nose stud) during the session. HAM admitted this fact but explained that he had been advised by his doctors not to remove it for the time being. In response to a request by the Stewards, the team produced reports from a medical practitioner which confirmed HAMâ€™s explanation. The Stewards then consulted the FIA Deputy Medical Delegate, Dr Ian Roberts, who viewed the medical report and concurred with the opinion therein. In light of the extenuating circumstances, we have determined to take no further action. Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
