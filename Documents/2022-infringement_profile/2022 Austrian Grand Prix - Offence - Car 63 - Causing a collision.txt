From The Stewards To The Team Manager, Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 TeamDocument 61 Date 10 July 2022 Time 15:40 2022 AUSTRIAN GRAND PRIX 07 - 10 July 2022 The StewardsThe Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following matter and determine the following: No / Driver 63 - George Russell Competitor Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team Time 15:03 Session Race Fact Collision with car 11 at turn 4. Offence Breach of Article 2 d) Chapter IV Appendix L of the FIA International Sporting Code. Decision 5 second time penalty. 2 penalty points (total of 3 for the 12 month period). Reason The Stewards reviewed the video evidence and determined that car 63 was wholly at fault for the incident. Car 11 was passing on the outside at turn 4, was at least fully alongside at the entry of the turn and all the way through the manoeuvre, including at the apex of the corner and left sufficient room for car 63, which ultimately struck car 11. This was not considered as a “first lap incident” as this was a battle between the two cars and was not affected by the pack of cars as can happen during the first lap. Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
