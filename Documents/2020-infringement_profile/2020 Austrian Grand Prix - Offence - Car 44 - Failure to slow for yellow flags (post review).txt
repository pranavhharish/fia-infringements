Offence Breach of Appendix H Article 2.5.5.1.b) of the FIA International Sporting Code. Decision Drop of 3 grid positions. (2 penalty points awarded, 5 points in total for the 12 month period) Reason Following a petition to review decision 33 taken after Qualifying, the Stewards acknowledged that the on-board footage of car 44 represents a significant new element (see decision 41) that had not been available to the Stewards in the hearing on Saturday and therefore reviewed the case. The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 44 (Lewis Hamilton) and the team representative and have reviewed the new video evidence and telemetry evidences. The new video footage clearly shows that a yellow light panel was flashing on the left side of the track in turn 5. A green light panel was flashing at the end of marshalling sector 9. Taking into account these facts, the Stewards determine that decision 33 will be reversed and the above mentioned penalty is being imposed. Gerd Ennser Felix Holter Vitantonio Liuzzi Walter Jobst
