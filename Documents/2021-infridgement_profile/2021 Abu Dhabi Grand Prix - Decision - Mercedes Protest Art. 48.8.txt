Conclusions of the Stewards : The Stewards consider that the protest is admissible. Having considered the various statements made by the parties. The Stewards determine that although Car 33 did at one stage, for a very short peri od of time, move slightly in front of Car 44, at a time when both cars where accelerating and braking, it moved back behind Car 44 and it was not in front when the Safety Ca r period ended (i.e. at the line). Accordingly, the Protest is dismissed and the Protest Deposit is not refunded.
