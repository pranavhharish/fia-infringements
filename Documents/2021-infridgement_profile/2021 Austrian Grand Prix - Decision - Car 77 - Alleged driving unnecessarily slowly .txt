From The Stewards To The Team Manager, Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 TeamDocument 36 Date 03 July 2021 Time 19:24 2021 AUSTRIAN GRAND PRIX 01 - 04 July 2021 The StewardsThe Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (document 31) and heard from the driver and team representative, have considered the following matter and determine the following: No / Driver 77 - Valtteri Bottas Competitor Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team Time 15:39 Session Qualifying Fact Alleged driving unnecessarily slowly in the entry to turn 9 and 10. Offence Alleged breach of Article 27.4 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations. Decision No further action. Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 77 (Valtteri Bottas) and team representative and reviewed video evidence. At the end of Q2 BOT slowed down at the entry of T9 to create a gap for his final lap. This is contrary to the Race Directors event notes 24.2a. However, given the situation that many drivers ended up queuing at this part of the circuit, the Stewards determine that too many drivers contributed to the situation and therefore the driver concerned is not fully to blame. Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and Article 10.1.1 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
