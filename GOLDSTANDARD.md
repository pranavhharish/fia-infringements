# Hierarchical Summarization Workflow for Mercedes F1 Infractions

## Overview

This notebook implements a 2-level hierarchical summarization approach to analyze Mercedes F1 infringement documents.

**Flow:**
```
Level 1: Group by infraction type → 9 cluster summaries (300 words each)
Level 2: Synthesize all clusters → 1 final team profile (200-250 words)
```

## CELL 1: Group Data by Infraction Type

**Description for Claude Code:**
```
Group all 102 Mercedes documents by primary_infraction type.

For each infraction type:
1. Filter documents belonging to that type
2. Count total documents in each group
3. Combine all relevant information (document_number, date, driver, 
   car_number, penalty_description, decision_text) into a formatted 
   text block for each document
4. Concatenate all documents within each group

Create a dataframe 'infraction_groups' with columns:
- infraction_type
- document_count
- documents_text (all documents combined and formatted)

Format each document within the group as:
"Document {doc_number} | {date} | {driver} (Car {car_number})
Penalty: {penalty_description}
Details: {decision_text}
---"

Display:
1. Number of unique infraction types (should be 9)
2. Document count per infraction type
3. Preview of first 500 characters from one group's documents_text

Save to: 'infraction_groups.csv'
```

---

## CELL 2: Create Function to Generate Cluster Summaries

**Description for Claude Code:**
```
Create a function that generates cluster summary prompts and calls LLM.

Function: generate_cluster_summary(infraction_type, count, documents_text)

Inside the function:
1. Create the prompt directly:

prompt = f"""Below are all Mercedes FIA steward decisions for {infraction_type} infractions ({count} total incidents):

{documents_text}

Based on these {count} incidents, create a comprehensive summary (exactly 300 words) analyzing:
1. Common scenarios and circumstances (when/where these infractions occur)
2. Drivers most frequently involved (with specific counts)
3. Typical penalties applied (ranges and averages)
4. Patterns over time (any changes across seasons/years)
5. Notable or recurring situations
6. Key statistics (percentages, frequencies)

Be factual, objective, and data-driven. Include specific numbers and trends."""

2. Call LLM API with this prompt
   For now, create a placeholder: call_llm_api(prompt, model="gpt-4")
   Add comments explaining where to add API key and configuration

3. Return the summary text

Display:
1. The function structure
2. Test with one example infraction type showing the generated prompt
3. Explain where API integration will be added
```

## CELL 3: Generate All Level 1 Cluster Summaries

**Description for Claude Code:**
```
Loop through all 9 infraction types and generate Level 1 cluster summaries.

Process:
1. Load the infraction_groups.csv (from Cell 1)
2. For each row in the dataframe:
   - Extract infraction_type, document_count, and documents_text
   - Call generate_cluster_summary(infraction_type, document_count, documents_text)
   - Store the returned summary
3. Create results dataframe with columns:
   - infraction_type
   - document_count
   - summary (300-word LLM-generated summary)
   - word_count (calculate and verify it's around 300)
   - model_used (e.g., "gpt-4" or "mock" for testing)
   - generation_timestamp


Save to: 'level1_cluster_summaries.csv'

Display:
1. The complete dataframe with all 9 summaries
2. Word count statistics (min, max, average)
3. One full example summary
4. Confirmation of successful save
```

---

## CELL 4: Generate Final Team Profile (Level 2)

**Description for Claude Code:**
```
Load level1_cluster_summaries.csv and generate the final Mercedes team profile.

Process:
1. Load all 9 cluster summaries from level1_cluster_summaries.csv

2. Create a function: generate_final_profile(cluster_summaries_df)

Inside the function:
- Build the Level 2 prompt by combining all cluster summaries:

prompt = f"""Below are comprehensive summaries of Mercedes F1 Team's infractions, organized by infraction type (102 total incidents):

"""

For each row in cluster_summaries_df:
    prompt += f"""{row['infraction_type'].upper()} INFRACTIONS ({row['document_count']} incidents):
{row['summary']}

---

"""

prompt += """Based on these detailed infraction analyses, create a final comprehensive Mercedes F1 Team profile (200-250 words) that provides:

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Overall infringement landscape (2-3 sentences)
2. KEY PATTERNS: Most significant infraction categories and their characteristics
3. DRIVER ANALYSIS: Notable driver involvement patterns
4. SEVERITY TRENDS: Penalty patterns and changes over time
5. STRATEGIC INSIGHTS: What these patterns reveal about the team

Be concise, analytical, and objective. Focus on the big picture while citing specific statistics."""

- Call LLM API with this prompt (or use mock for testing)
- Return the final profile summary

3. Call the function and save results to: 'level2_final_profile.csv'

Columns:
- model_used
- summary (200-250 words)
- word_count
- generation_timestamp

4. Also save just the summary text to: 'final_mercedes_profile.txt'

Display:
1. The complete Level 2 prompt (first 1000 characters)
2. The final profile summary in full
3. Word count verification (should be 200-250)
4. Confirmation messages with file locations
```

## Output Files - ALL THESE FILES ARE SAVED IN THE outputs/goldstandards

After running all cells, you will have:

✅ `infraction_groups.csv` - 9 infraction clusters with combined documents  
✅ `level1_cluster_summaries.csv` - 9 cluster summaries (300 words each)  
✅ `level2_final_profile.csv` - Final team profile metadata  
✅ `final_mercedes_profile.txt` - Final summary text (200-250 words)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Integrate actual LLM API** (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
2. **Create gold standards** (manually review and correct 3-4 cluster summaries + 1 final profile)
3. **Test other models** (LexRank, TextRank, BART, T5, PEGASUS)
4. **Evaluate with ROUGE/BLEU** (compare model outputs to gold standards)
