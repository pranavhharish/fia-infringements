2020,2020 Austrian Grand Prix,"From The Stewards To The Team Manager, Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 TeamDocument 41 Date 05 July 2020 Time 14:24 2020 AUSTRIAN GRAND PRIX 2 - 5 July 2020 The Stewards received a petition from Aston Martin Red Bull Racing (including video footage) for them to review, in accordance with Article 14 of the FIA International Sporting Code, the following decision made by the Stewards at the 2020 Austrian Grand Prix Competition: Document 33 – 2020 Austrian Grand Prix. The Stewards, summoned the team (Document 39) and held a hearing at 13:45 on Sunday 5th July, 2020. The Stewards heard the driver and the team representative.

Offence Involved in an incident defined by Article 38.1 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations. Decision 5 second time penalty. 2 penalty points imposed, total of 7 in the 12 month period Reason The Stewards reviewed video evidence showing that cars 23 and 44 were side by side approaching the apex of turn 4. They negotiated the turn side by side, but car 23 had a better exit and was in the process of passing car 44. Car 44 was drafting to the outside at the exit of turn 4 and consequently making contact with the rear right wheel of car 23, causing car 23 to spin. The Stewards determined that the driver of car 44 is predominantly to blame for the collision.

2020,2020 Sakhir Grand Prix,"From The Stewards To The Team Manager, Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 TeamDocument 38 Date 06 December 2020 Time 23:59 2020 SAKHIR GRAND PRIX 3 - 6 December 2020 The Stewards, having received a report from the Technical Delegate (document 34), summoned (document 35) and heard from the team representative, have considered the following matter and determine the following: No / Driver 63 - George Russell Competitor Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team Time 21:16 Session Race Fact Incorrect use of tyres Offence Breach of Article 24.2 a) and 24.3 e) of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations. Decision A fine of €20,000 is imposed on the competitor Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 team (see reasons below). Reason The Stewards heard from the Mr Ron Meadows (team representative) and Mr Nikolas Tombazis (FIA Formula One Technical Delegate). As described in the latter’s report (document 34) Car 63 was fitted with front tyres that were allocated to Car 77. This was caused by a radio communications technical issue wherein the pit wall’s communication to the pit crew that Car 63 was entering the pits prior to (and not after) Car 77, failed to be received by the crew of Car 63 because at the same time, the driver of Car 63 transmitted over the top of that message. This resulted in the front tyres of Car 77 accidentally going onto Car 63. (The cars were “double stacked” at the time.) This is clearly a breach of the regulations and would normally involve a sporting penalty up to Disqualification. However, in this case there are mitigating circumstances, additional to the radio issue referred to above. Firstly, the team rectified the problem within 1 lap. This involved Car 63 making another pit stop, thus dropping it further down the classification. Secondly, Car 77 made a pit stop to change tyres only to find that the front tyres to be fitted to it, were on Car 63, so was sent out after considerable delay, with the tyres that were on Car 77 prior to the pit stop. This also impacted the final classification of Car 77. Thirdly, although this type of infringement is not catered for under the “3 lap tolerance” referred to in the second paragraph of Article 24.4 b) (which currently only refers to the use of tyres of differing specifications), we consider it to be similar in nature. However, the responsibility to fit tyres in compliance with the regulations, still rests with The Stewardsany team and thus a penalty is considered as being required. It is recommended that the FIA consider amending Article 24.4 b) to accommodate this type of breach when it is rectified without delay. It is noted that this type of breach has not previously been experienced in Formula One. Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and Article 10.1.1 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.

Procedure: 1. On December 12 the parties were summoned at 1945 hrs (Documents 52 and 53) and heard. The following persons were present during the hearing. On behalf of Mercedes: ‐ Ron Meadows ‐ Andrew Shovlin ‐ Paul Harris (Team Legal Counsel) On behalf of Red Bull: ‐ Jonathan Wheatley 2. At the hearing there were no objections agai nst the composition of the Stewards panel. The parties set out oral arguments and address ed the questions asked by the Stewards. 3. At the hearing the parties referred to t he documents submitted. None of the parties submitted further evidence or initiat ed the hearing of additional persons or conducting further investigations. The claims of Mercedes: Mercedes claimed that Car 33 overtook Car 44 during the Safety Car period at 1832hrs, in breach of Article 48.8 of the 2021 Fo rmula One Sporting Regulations. Red Bull’s arguments in defence: Red Bull argued that Car 44 was not “overtaken” by Car 33, that both cars were “on and off the throttle” and that there were “a million prec edents” under Safety Car where cars had pulled alongside then moved back behind the Car that was in front. Conclusions of the Stewards : The Stewards consider that the protest is admissible. Having considered the various statements made by the parties. The Stewards determine that although Car 33 did at one stage, for a very short peri od of time, move slightly in front of Car 44, at a time when both cars where accelerating and braking, it moved back behind Car 44 and it was not in front when the Safety Ca r period ended (i.e. at the line).

2021,2021 Brazilian Grand Prix,"From The Stewards To The Team Manager, Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 TeamDocument 29 Date 13 November 2021 Time 14:00 2021 BRAZILIAN GRAND PRIX 11 - 14 November 2021 The Stewards, having received a report from the Technical Delegate (Document 18), summoned (documents 19 ,24) and heard from the team representatives, have considered the following matter and determine the following: No / Driver 44 - Lewis Hamilton Competitor Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team Time 18:28 Session Qualifying Fact Could not fulfil the requirement of a maximum 85mm measurement (adjustable positions of uppermost rear wing element). Offence Breach of Article 3.6.3 of the FIA Formula One Technical Regulations. Decision Car 44 is disqualified from the results of qualifying (Art. 12.4.1 m of the FIA International Sporting Code) Reason Reason The Technical Delegate reported that Car 44 failed the test designed to check the requirements of the last paragraph of Art. 3.6.3 of the 2021 FIA Formula 1 Technical Regulations. The check is described in Technical Directive 011-19. In lay terms, there is a gap between the upper and lower parts of the rear wing. When the DRS is not activated this gap must be between 10mm and 15mm. The car passed this part of the test. When DRS is activated, which raises the upper element of the wing to a flatter position, the gap must be between 10mm and 85mm. The maximum gap is measured, in accordance with TD/011-19, by pushing an 85mm gauge against the gap with a maximum load of 10N (ten newtons.) If the gauge goes through then the car has failed the test. In this case, the gauge would not pass through at the inner section of the wing, but did at the outer section of the wing. This test was repeated four times with two different gauges, once being done in the presence of the Stewards and representatives of the Competitor. The Stewards held a hearing on Friday following qualifying with Ron Meadows, the Competitor representative, and Simon Cole, the Chief Engineer, Trackside and from the FIA Jo Bauer, Technical Delegate and Nicholas Tombazis, Single Seater Technical Director. The Stewards then adjourned the hearing to gather more evidence and at 10:30am on Saturday morning held a further hearing that also included John Owen, Chief Designer for the Competitor, who testified by video conference, but did not include Joe Bauer. The Competitor asserted that the design is intended to meet the regulations. It was clear to the Stewards that the additional deflection was due to additional play either in the DRS actuator or the pivots at the end, or some combination or other fault with the mechanism, or incorrect assembly of the parts. The Stewards heard, from both the team and the FIA that the same design has been tested many times during the season and uniformly passed. Further, the FIA has examined the design of the area of the car in question and are satisfied that the design meets the intent of the regulation. There is therefore no question in the minds of the Stewards that the test failure indicates any intent to exceed the maximum dimension either by action or design. The Competitor also noted, that Art 3.6.3 of the regulation states a maximum dimension, which is possible to measure without applying a force or load. It is not until a force is applied, that the gauge is able to go through. There was no disagreement that the test itself was undertaken as described in TD/011-19. The gauges were measured and the Stewards were satisfied that they were the correct dimension. The Competitor therefore argues that their car complied with the regulation in the static position and thus meets the regulation. The FIA argues that while not regulatory, the TD, like many others, describes the procedure for the test so that competitors may design cars to meet the regulations. Further, the TD states that the test is designed “to make sure that the rear wing element does not deflect to a larger opening than the permitted value…”. The Stewards take the position that while a TD is not in itself a regulation, TDs are accepted as the method upon which the teams may rely and in this case, the test that was carried out was in conformity with the TD and its legitimate aims. The Competitor alleged that the fact that the car passed the test in the center section of the wing is both a mitigating factor and shows that there was no intent to breach the regulation. While the Stewards accept that the latter point may be true, the Stewards believe that which sections failed is not relevant to the fact that the wing did fail the test. The Competitor noted that this is not a systemic breach, and is indeed unique. It was, rather, something gone wrong. The Competitor further noted that they would have liked to have had the opportunity to inspect the parts with a view to having some explanation for the Stewards as to how the problem arose. However, the Stewards fundamentally accept the Competitor’s explanation that the cause of the failed test was something “gone wrong” rather than a deliberate action. The Stewards therefore chose to keep the assembly under seal and preserve the evidence of the failure, rather than altering the parts in an inspection which would have involved some handling of the parts and thus some alteration of the evidence. The final point of the Competitor regarding the assembly itself is that it is regular practice for the FIA Technical Department to allow teams to fix minor problems that they find with their cars, even during the Parc Fermé conditions of qualifying. Had the Competitor recognized this problem during qualifying they surely would have sought, and the FIA Technical Department confirmed, they would have received permission to fix the parts or tighten bolts if needed. The Stewards were sympathetic to this argument and analyzed whether they felt this was a mitigating circumstance. It is often a mitigating circumstance to make allowances for crash damage. However, the Stewards could not extend this argument to cover parts that were found out of conformity in post session checks with no obvious reason in evidence other than considering normal running at this Event. In the end, the regulations are clear and at the moment of the conformity check, the car did not comply. At the end of the first hearing on Friday, amateur video emerged of driver Max Verstappen touching car 44 in Parc Fermé. The Stewards took the time to gather all the available video footage of this incident and finally reviewed in car footage from car 14, car 77, car 33 and car 44 as well as CCTV footage from the FIA’s pit lane cameras, in addition to the amateur footage. The Stewards held a separate hearing in relation to this incident and incorporate the text of that decision herein. The Stewards However, in summary the Competitor of car 44 also agreed that it was unlikely that Verstappen’s actions caused the fault, however they felt that it was an open question. The Stewards, however, were fully satisfied, having extensively reviewed the totality of the evidence regarding that incident, that it has no bearing on this case. Finally, therefore, the Stewards decide that car 44 failed the test indicated in TD/011- 19 and is therefore in breach of Art 3.6.3 of the FIA Formula 1 Technical Regulations. The Stewards agree with the Competitor that this is something gone wrong, rather than an intentional act or design but did not find there to be mitigating circumstances. Further, Art 1.3.3 of the International Sporting Code states that “it shall be no defence to claim that no performance advantage was obtained”. Therefore, the Stewards order the usual penalty for technical non-compliance of Disqualification from the qualifying session. Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.

Offence Breach of Appendix L Chapter III Article 4 of the FIA International Sporting Code. Decision The driver is fined €5,000 with an additional €20,000 which is suspended through the end of 2022. Reason The Stewards heard from the team representative and reviewed video evidence. The driver of car 44, Lewis Hamilton, undid his seat belts on the in-lap at the end of the race. While the Stewards are sympathetic to the desire to celebrate, it is fundamentally unsafe to undo the seatbelts while the car is in motion. Slow speeds in these cars are very fast for an unrestrained occupant. Further, Formula 1 drivers set the example for junior categories. It is critical that junior category drivers learn the importance of using all the safety devices of the car at all times. The suspension of the penalty is subject to compliance with Appendix L, Ch. III of the ISC during the period specified.

The driver was given a 10 second warning that Car 9 was approaching when he was at Turn 2. Due to a failure in communication by the Team he was not given another warning until Car 9 was alongside him. The Stewards accept that this circuit presents challenges for drivers in relation to using their mirrors as the method of determining the approach of overtaking cars.

This did not happen in this case and accordingly the penalty for the Competitor is imposed.

Offence Breach of Appendix L Ch IV Art 1, Appendix H 2.5.4.1.b of the FIA International Sporting Code. Decision No penalty is applied. Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 44 (Lewis Hamilton) and the team representative. The Stewards reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, telemetry, team radio and in-car video. There is no dispute that Car 44 passed Car 20 directly after the track was placed in a Red Flag condition. The driver of Car 44 stated that he was on a fast lap, he saw the Red Light, immediately completely lifted the throttle and applied the brakes, whilst checking his mirrors for cars following in close proximity. He stated that he had, in doing so, gone past Car 20. The Stewards took note of the precedent in relation to the 2021 Dutch Grand Prix (Max Verstappen), where no action was taken against the driver under similar but not identical circumstances. The telemetry evidence was sourced directly from the live data available to the FIA not from any evidence provided by the team. The telemetry data clearly shows the following; 1. That immediately when the red light was displayed, the driver lifted throttle 100% 2. That immediately when the red light was displayed, the driver applied firm braking pressure. 3. The speed of Car 44 at this point was 288 km/h. (Car 20 had a speed of 126 km/h at this point – a delta of 162 km/h). The StewardsIt is our conclusion that the driver of Car 44 took every reasonable action to comply with the regulations in that he immediately reduced speed in a safe manner at the earliest opportunity upon the first indication of the red light. Notwithstanding, technically this is still a breach of Art 2.5.4.1 b of Cpt IV of Appendix H of the International Sporting Code, however he could not avoid overtaking Car 20 in this case and therefore the Stewards DETERMINE to apply no penalty. It is noted the there was no breach of Article 37.6 of the Formula 1 Sporting Regulations.

Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 44 (Lewis Hamilton), the driver of Car 4 (Lando Norris) and the team representatives, and examined video, radio communication and GPS evidence. The driver, in evidence, stated that he did slow down in order to endeavour to be passed by car 4, to achieve a “tow” on his fast lap, however car 4 obviously had the same intent and decided not to pass him. Although car 44 was slow, the Stewards note that for the lap the delta time was respected, the driver pulled over to the left and off the racing line, this occurred on a straight where visibility was not an issue and there was no potential danger at any point, to any other driver. The three cars on this portion of track at the time (cars 44, 4 and 3) were all on “out” laps.

Offence Breach of Article 2 d) Chapter IV Appendix L of the FIA International Sporting Code. Decision No further action. Reason The Stewards reviewed the video evidence and determined that Alonso was on the inside at turn 5. Hamilton’s front wheels were ahead of Alonso’s at the entry to the corner. Alonso moved his car off line to the inside with both right side tyres fully on the kerb and even somewhat inside the kerb. At no point did Alonso appear to lose control or understeer. Hamilton turned into towards the apex of the corner with Alonso still along side and the collision occurred.

The Stewards determined that Car 55 was approaching turn 13 at higher speed than Car 44. Car 55 was finishing a fast lap while Car 44 was preparing for the next lap. During the hearing, both drivers and team representatives recognised that it is well understood that impeding during free practice should be looked at in a more lenient way by the Stewards unless it is a dangerous manoeuvre. Both drivers also highlighted that the configuration of the track is propitious for impeding and that Car 55 was not significantly impacted by the action. Therefore, the Stewards decided to take no further action.

Infringement Breach of Article 19.1 a) of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations. Decision Team reprimand. Reason The Stewards received a report from the Media Delegate that the the driver of Car 44 (Lewis Hamilton), was late for the Thursday Press Conference. The Stewards heard from the team representative and determined that the driver was indeed late for the Press Conference. The team representative noted that his driver’s schedule was controlled by the team, and given that this was his home race, the schedule was extremely busy. In addition, it is difficult for Hamilton to move through the paddock. While the Stewards understand this to be the case, it is also true that this is an activity required by the regulations, that late attendance is disruptive to the press conference, and that there is significant interest by the media in talking to the drivers who’s access is limited. The Stewards considered that these activities on Thursday of the race weekend are different that pre-race activities which have an effect on the flow of the competition and can provide an advantage to a driver’s preparation. Activities on Thursday are generally organized by the teams and the drivers follow the instructions of their team coordinators. Therefore, the Stewards determined that the most appropriate penalty was to the team rather than to the driver. As some leeway has been given previously the Stewards consider a Reprimand to the team to be appropriate, with the warning that further penalties may be considered in case of repetition.

Infringment Alleged breach of Article 33.4 and 37.5 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations. Decision No further action. Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 20 (Kevin Magnussen), the driver of Car 44 (Lewis Hamilton), team representatives and reviewed video, team radio and in-car video evidence and determined that Car 20 was on a slow lap, with another slow car in front of it. Car 44 was on an in-lap and could see Car 20 at the end of the straight. The unexpectedly high speed differential between the two cars resulted in Car 44 having to take evasive action to avoid a collision. Given that neither car was on a fast lap and the fact that Car 20 had another slow car ahead of it, we did not consider either driver to be driving dangerously. Given that they were not on fast laps, there was no question of impeding either. So in the circumstances, we decided to take no further action. Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.

Infringement Breach of Article 26.7 b) of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations. Decision Reprimand (Non-driving) This is the driver’s 1st reprimand of the season. The driver is fined €50,000, €25,000 of which is suspended for the remainder of the 2023 season on condition that there is no further breach of similar nature. Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car ​​44 ( Lewis Hamilton), team representative and reviewed video evidence. After crashing out of the race in Lap 1, the driver of Car 44 abandoned his car in the gravel and ran back to the pits. He thereby crossed the track that was live at this time and reached the inside edge of the track just seconds before Car 63 arrived at high speed after exiting the pits. He then continued to walk alongside the track until finally exiting the track. During the hearing the driver of Car 44 was very apologetic and realized that the situation could have been very dangerous for him as well as the drivers approaching. The Stewards reinforced the fact that crossing a live track can cause extremely dangerous situations and the drivers have to be very cautious about it. In addition to imposing a significant fine (which is suspended in parts), the Stewards also reprimand the driver bearing in mind that receiving a certain number of reprimands during a season will draw a significant driving penalty in accordance with Article 18.2 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations. Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.

Infringement Breaches of Article 33.4 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations and Article 12.2.1 i) of the International Sporting Code and non-compliance with Race Director’s Event Note (item 14, document 4). Decision Drop of 2 grid positions for the next Race in which the driver participates. Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 63 (George Russell), the team representative and reviewed in-car video evidence. In order to avoid situations like the ones that occurred in Mexico, the Race Director’s Event Notes for this event contained a specific clause (item 14) stipulating that it was permitted to go slow in the pit exit to create a gap before crossing the SC2 line, however, by doing so, a driver must stay as far to the left as possible to allow other drivers to pass on the right side. RUS was exiting the pits, preparing for an out lap. RUS went slow to create a gap for a clear lap, but did not manage to stay completely to the left. As a result, following car(s) were not able to overtake, as intended by the Race Director’s instructions.

Car 63 entered the last two corners preparing for his flying lap at the end of SQ1 with Car 16 closing in quickly. Whilst the team did inform the driver about the closing car a few seconds in advance, there was no further information directly before Car 63 entered Turn 19 with Car 16 right behind.

Infringement Breach of Article 3.5.9 e) of the FIA Formula One Technical Regulations. Decision Car 44 is disqualified from the Race (Article 12.4.1.m of the FIA International Sporting Code). The other competitors move up in the classification. Reason The Stewards heard from the team representatives of Car 44, the Technical Delegate, the FIA Single Seater Director and the FIA Single Seater Technical Director. During the hearing the team acknowledged that the measurement performed by the FIA Technical Team was correct and stated that the high wear on the skid pads was probably a result of the unique combination of the bumpy track and the Sprint race schedule that minimized the time to set up and check the car before the race. The Stewards note that the onus is on the competitor to ensure that the car is in compliance with the regulations at all times during an event. In this particular case, the rear skid in the area defined in the Technical Delegate’s report was outside of the thresholds outlined in Article 3.5.9 e) of the FIA Formula One Technical Regulations, which includes a tolerance for wear.

Infringement Breach of Appendix H, Article 2.5.5 b) of the International Sporting Code and non- compliance with Race Director’s Event Notes (item 1, document 21). Decision Reprimand (Driving). Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 63 (George Russell), team representative and reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, telemetry and in-car video evidence. This was a very similar case to the decision of this panel of Stewards regarding Charles Leclerc (document 29) with some important differences. Sainz ran into the runoff at Turn 2. Russell was the next car on track and was fully committed to his braking, and unlike Leclerc, was already turning into the corner, when the yellow flag was displayed on the far right of the runoff. The Stewards consider that there was no reasonable way for Russell to have seen that flag and even if he had, he could not have changed his braking. Once he rounded the corner, Russell accelerated normally. Unlike Leclerc, however, the illuminated green light panel between turn 2 and turn 3, was a significant distance further down the track and harder to see at the point of acceleration than in the case of Leclerc. But, ultimately, Russell did see the green. Russell also did not get the benefit of the DRS in that zone because it was automatically switched off, slowing his lap. The Stewards pointed out in the Leclerc decision many mitigating factors. In this case, the Stewards believe there is further mitigation. However, it is a matter of safety that the drivers understand that when they have seen a car in a runoff, and green light indicates that they are inside of a yellow sector and that some indication, such as a lift or at least limited acceleration, acknowledging that other issues can occur within a yellow zone. Thus, in this limited set of circumstances, in particular that the yellow flag could not have been seen, the Stewards order a Driving Reprimand rather than a more serious The Stewardspenalty. The Stewards recommend that this matter be clarified in the next Drivers’ meeting and note that these penalties should not represent a binding precedent. Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.

Infringement Breach of Article 37.5 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations. Decision Drop of 3 grid positions for the next Race in which the driver participates. Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 11 (Sergio Perez), the driver of Car 44 (Lewis Hamilton), team representatives and reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, timing, telemetry, team radio and in-car video evidence. The driver of Car 44, being on an in lap, was informed by the team that Car 11 was approaching on a fast lap when he entered Turn 8. He then drove off line at the exit of Turn 8 with the intention to give way for Car 11. However, when Car 11 arrived, Car 44 had already entered Turn 9 and drove back towards the racing line at the exit of Turn 9, thereby clearly impeding Car 11. The Stewards determine that, whilst there has been appropriate warning by the team and albeit the driver tried to move out of the way, he could have slowed down more in order not to impede the other car and therefore consider the impeding to be unnecessary in the sense of the regulations. Therefore a grid drop is applied in line with previous decisions.

Infringement Breach of Article 34.14 a) of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations. Decision The competitor (Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 Team) is fined €5,000. Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 63 (George Russell), the driver of Car 81 (Oscar Piastri), team representatives and reviewed external and in-car video evidence. The driver of Car 63 stated that on receiving the release signal from his mechanic, he had intended to drive down the working lane, however he saw the mechanic from Car 44 in his peripheral vision and in order to avoid him, he claimed he had to move into the fast lane. He was not able to see the approach of Car 81. The driver of Car 81 stated that he had to take avoiding action by steering away from the approaching Car 63. Examination of the pit lane video shows that the mechanic of Car 63 who released the car did not look down to pit lane to see if it was clear. Even though the stated intention of the team was for Car 63 to move down the working lane then blend in prior to the pit exit, it is still the responsibility of the team to release the car in a safe manner and good practice would dictate that prior to the car being released, the pit lanes (both fast and working) should be checked for approaching vehicles.

Infringement Breach of Article 37.5 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations. Decision Warning. The competitor (Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 Team) is fined €15,000. Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 44 (Lewis Hamilton), the driver of Car 2 (Logan Sargeant), team representatives and reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, team radio and in-car video evidence and determine that Car 44 impeded Car 2 at Turn 11. As a result, Car 2 had to take evasive action by going off the track to avoid a collision. Had that not been done, there would have been a serious, high speed crash. Having listened to the team radio, it was clear to us that the team of Car 44 failed to warn their driver of the fact that Car 2 was arriving on a fast lap. That was a serious failure on the part of the team, particularly given the speeds on this circuit and the nature of turn 11, which is at the end of a series of high speed corners where driver visibility is impaired. We therefore issue a warning to the driver and impose a fine of €15,000 to the team.

Infringement Breach of Article 30.5 a) of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations. Decision The competitor (Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 Team) is fined €5,000. Reason The Stewards heard from the team representative of Car 63 (George Russell), the FIA Technical Delegate, a member of his team and the FIA Single Seater Director. After the race start was aborted the 10 minute notice was immediately given for the new start. Given the layout of the circuit and the access point to the grid from the pit lane the time period for the team to get to the grid was extended. The gate to access the grid was not immediately opened. The FIA accepted that given this short notice it was extremely difficult if not impossible for the teams to follow the procedure prescribed in the technical directive. The FIA Technical Delegate stipulated that the tyre pressures while having been adjusted by the team was within the allowed parameters. Given the unusual circumstances surrounding the compressed time table, aborted start, the grid access logistics and given the stipulation from the Technical Delegate that the tyre pressures were within the correct parameters, the Stewards determine that a fine for a breach of procedure is appropriate in this case. Normally a breach of this nature, within a competitive session would carry a sporting penalty but it is not appropriate in this case.

Infringement Breach of Article 47.1 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations. Decision Reprimand (Driving). The driver is fined €5,000. Reason The Stewards heard from the team representative and reviewed video evidence. The FIA Formula One Race Director initiated the Aborted Start procedure indicating that the drivers should not leave the grid. This message was necessary as there was a car off track in Turn 4 (STR) that needed to be recovered. Although the signal was appropriately given the light panel illuminated as prescribed, and the teams notified by the messaging system, the driver left the grid and proceeded on a lap that he assumed to be an extra formation lap. As the driver was on the front row of the grid this triggered following drivers to take similar action. At some point the Race Director realizing that for practical reasons all cars would now need to do an extra formation lap gave an instruction to the teams for all cars to proceed and return to the grid to follow the correct aborted start procedure. In the opinion of the stewards the driver RUS precipitated the action of the drivers on the grid directly behind him.

Infringement Breach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 b) of the International Sporting Code. Decision 5 second time penalty. Reason The Stewards reviewed positioning/marshalling system data and in-car video evidence. The Driving Standard Guidelines provide that when overtaking on the inside the driver must not force the other car off the track and must leave a fair and acceptable width for the car being overtaken. This did not occur on this occasion. However in mitigation, a 5 second penalty is imposed instead of the standard 10 second penalty because the Stewards determine that the forcing off track was not deliberate, and the driver of Car 63 was in control of the car at all times. Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
